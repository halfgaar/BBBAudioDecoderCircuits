- Jumpers DIR9001 weg?
- De TOSlink plug, moet dat op een los bordje, voor paneelbevestiging?
- Multiple inputs?
- BUG: it sometimes refused to boot. I saw the blue lights go off again when
  the boot process was initiated. The LCD backlight dipped. Scope image
  revealved dips in the rail. I added 4700µF to before the positive regulators.
  That prevented the dips. I'm not sure if 4700µF in total would be enough. The
  change has not been made to the PCB design (yet).
